Prisma and [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) ...!!intro sentence

This document discusses the concepts behind using Prisma and CockroachDB, explains the commonalities and differences between CockroachDB and other database providers, and leads you through the process for configuring your application to integrate with CockroachDB.

## What is CockroachDB?

CockroachDB is a distributed database that is designed for scalability and high availability. Features include:

- !!include...
- **Compatibility with PostgreSQL:** Cockroach is compatible with PostgreSQL, allowing interoperability with a large ecosystem of existing products.

## Commonalities with other database providers

Many aspects of using Prisma with CockroachDB are just like using Prisma with any other relational database. You can still:

- model your database with the [Prisma Schema Language](/concepts/components/prisma-schema)
- connect to your database, using the [`cockroachdb` database connector](/concepts/database-connectors/cockroachdb)
- use [Introspection](/concepts/components/introspection) for existing projects if you already have a CockroachDB database
- use [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) to migrate your database schema to a new version
- use [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) in your application to query your database in a type safe way based on your Prisma Schema

## Differences to consider

CockroachDB is compatible with PostgreSQL and most

However, you should be aware of some differences:

- **Cockroach-specific native types.** CockroachDB has its own set of native types which are supported in Prisma. To learn more, see [How to use CockroachDB's native types](#how-to-use-cockroachdbs-native-types).

- **Creating integer sequences** CockroachDB provides many options for creating integer sequences in the underlying database. To support this, Prisma has introduced a `sequence()` function for CockroachDB. For more information, see [How to use CockroachDB's `sequence()` function](#how-to-use-cockroachdbs-sequence-function).

## More on using CockroachDB with Prisma

The fastest way to start using CockroachDB with Prisma is to refer to our Getting Started documentation:

- [Start from scratch](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-cockroachdb)
- [Add to existing project](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-cockroachdb)

These tutorials will take you through the process of connecting to CockroachDB, migrating your schema, and using the Prisma Client.

Further reference information is available in the [CockroachDB connector documentation](/concepts/database-connectors/cockroachdb).
